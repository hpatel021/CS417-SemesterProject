## CPU Temperature Parser
-  This C++ program is designed to parse CPU temperature data from an input file and organize it into a structured format.
-  The program provides flexibility by allowing the use of different container types for storing the parsed data. 

## Features
-  Flexible Container Type:
-  Core Temperature Reading Structure:

## Usage
  To use this program, follow these steps:
1.  Compile the code: Use a C++ compiler to compile the provided code. For example, you can use the following command:
    ```
    g++ -o parseTempsDriver parseTempsDriver.cpp
                         or
                        make
    ```
2.  Run the Program: Execute the compiled program with the input file name as a command-line argument. For example:
    ```
    ./parseTempsDriver input_file_name
    ```

## Cleaning
-  To remove the compiled files and clean the project directory, you can use the following command:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

## Input File Format
-  Ensure that your input file follows the expected format, where each line contains space-separated temperature readings for each CPU core.

## Example Output
